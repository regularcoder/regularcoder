*I've spent my life at home, eating the food my wife cooks, listening to music, and being with Hikari. I feel I have chosen a good career - an interesting career. Every morning, I have woken up knowing that I will never run out of books to read. That has been my life.*

Kenzaburo Oe, [The Art of Fiction No. 195](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5816/the-art-of-fiction-no-195-kenzaburo-oe)

## Read in 2015

1. The wind in my wheels by Josie Dew (3.5/5)
> This is one of a few books that mysteriously appeared on my bookshelf - it could have been a donation from a relative cleaning out their shelves. This is a travel book about a British girl who traveled all over the world on her bicycle. It is a pretty straighforward narration of events and is book length only because Josie traveled so much. She doesn't spend much time on history (unlike Paul Theroux for example) or off-topic personal anecdotes (like the delightful Bill Bryson).
> 
> The most remarkable thing about this book is that she kept cycling despite being victimized by men throughout her travels - flashers, bum patters, would be rapists, etc. Josie doesn't say this herself but I noticed that one thing common to all cultures seems to be the presence of a few abusive men who won't hesitate to get their jollies from a young woman traveling alone.

2. Psmith in the City by P. G. Wodehouse (3/5)
3. A Personal Matter by Kenzaburo Oe (4/5)
3. The Allow of Law: A Mistborn Novel by Brandon Sanderson (4.5/5)
4. The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene (4/5)
5. Singularity Sky by Charles Stross (3/5)
6. Waiting by Ha Jin (2.5/5)
> Ha Jin's love story set in Communist China lost my favor towards the end where at multiple times he seemed to be building towards a tragic end - only to happily resolve the situation and build up towards yet another tragedy that never happens. When the story *finally* petered out it wasn't a very satisfactory ending.
>
> An interesting (to me) fact is that Ha Jin lives and teaches in Boston - where I read this book.

7. The Insufferable Gaucho by Roberto Bolano (3.5/5)
> This book consists of four short stories and two essays. Although the short stories were easy to read I would be hard-pressed to explain what any of them really *mean*. Among the stories, I liked *Police Rat* best. It tells the story of Jose a.k.a Pepe the Cop, a rat who serves on the police force of an underground colony of rats and investigates a suspicious series of murders.
>
> The two essays are completely opposite to the short stories in terms of readability. They were dense, complex and I got very little out of them. 
8. The Giver by Lois Lowry (4/5)
9. Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card (3/5)
10. Ōoku: The Inner Chambers, Vol. 1 by Fumi Yoshinaga (4/5)
> I was lucky enough to get a mint condition copy of this manga from the public library. It is based in an alternate world where a mysterious disease kills most young men (and only men). The resulting imbalance in the gender ratio has resulted in society turning matriarchal with women filling most roles that men usually held. The Shogun is a woman and her harem, called the Ōoku, is filled with men instead of women.
>
> It is in this Ōoku that most of the story takes place. The Ōoku has an elaborate series of ranks and duties with many traditions, customs and rules. This is to be expected because of its insulation from the outside world - men once admitted to the Ōoku can never leave and are forbidden from speaking to outsiders about what goes on inside.
11. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin (3.5/5)
12. The Happiness Advantage by Shawn Achor (4/5)
> I came across Shawn Achor's ideas via his TED talk - [the happy secret to better work](http://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work?language=en). This book expands on the same idea - that happiness leads to success and not the other way around.
> Maybe it is because of where I am in my professional life right now but this book really spoke to me. I told a lot of people about it and plan to put its ideas and principles into practice in my life.
