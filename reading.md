I have always loved to read. Novels, comics, fiction, non-fiction, magazines, technical books, etc - I read anything as long as its interesting. I not only like collecting books but am also fond of tracking my reading since it gives me a sense of accomplishment.

*I've spent my life at home, eating the food my wife cooks, listening to music, and being with Hikari. I feel I have chosen a good career - an interesting career. Every morning, I have woken up knowing that I will never run out of books to read. That has been my life.*
