*I've spent my life at home, eating the food my wife cooks, listening to music, and being with Hikari. I feel I have chosen a good career - an interesting career. Every morning, I have woken up knowing that I will never run out of books to read. That has been my life.*

Kenzaburo Oe, [The Art of Fiction No. 195](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5816/the-art-of-fiction-no-195-kenzaburo-oe)

## Read in 2016

1. Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl (4/5) on [01-06-2016]

> The first part of this book is a brief biography covering Victor Frankl's time in Nazi concentration camps and the second is an introduction to *Logotherapy*.
>
> I found the second part of the book way more interesting, for example these words stuck with me: *"Sunday neurosis, that kind of depression which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest."*
2. Faerie Tale by Raymond Feist (2.5/5) on [01-16-2016]

> The sexual imagery in the book was often disturbing and some of the characters were unrealistic - Gabbie for instance is a stunningly beautiful millionaire heiress who has a good head on her shoulders.
