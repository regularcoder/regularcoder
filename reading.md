*I've spent my life at home, eating the food my wife cooks, listening to music, and being with Hikari. I feel I have chosen a good career - an interesting career. Every morning, I have woken up knowing that I will never run out of books to read. That has been my life.*

## Read in 2016

1. Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl (4/5) on [01-06-2016]
   
   > The first part of this book is a brief biography covering Victor Frankl's time in Nazi concentration camps and the second is an introduction to *Logotherapy*.
   >
   > I found the second part of the book way more interesting, for example these words stuck with me: *"Sunday neurosis, that kind of depression which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest."*

2. Faerie Tale by Raymond Feist (2.5/5) on [01-16-2016]

   > The sexual imagery in the book was often disturbing and some of the characters were unrealistic - Gabbie for instance is a stunningly beautiful millionaire heiress who has a good head on her shoulders.

3. A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway (4.5/5) on [01-18-2016]

   > This is a light and enjoyable memoir of Hemingway's time in Paris. Mixed in with a glimpse into his writing life are vignettes of his friends and acquaintences. What a group they were - James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso..

4. Claudius the God: And His Wife Messalina  by Robert Graves (2.5/5) on [01-31-2016]

   > I didn't enjoy this as much as *I, Claudius*

5. The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman (4/5) on [02-05-2016]

   > The mysterious and timeless Hempstock women were fascinating characters. I liked this way more than Neil Gaiman's *Anansi Boys* which I read a few years ago.

6. A Country Doctor's Notebook by Mikhail Bulgakov (4.5/5) on [03-26-2016]

   > These are a series of stories about Bulgakov's time in a remote rural hospital. He had just graduated from medical college and was sent off to run a clinic without any other doctors to support or guide him.
   > 
   > Being so fresh out of university he was petrified of encountering a case he had no idea how to handle. However, when a young girl who suffered a horrific accident that crushed her legs is brought to him he manages to amputate her leg and save her life. After that he became famous and often saw about a hundred patients a day!
   >
   > One line that I particularly like is at the end of a chapter where Bulgakov manages to perform a tricky childbirth successfully: *'One can gain a lot of experience in a country practice', I thought as I fell asleep, 'but even so one must go on and on reading, reading...more and more..'*

7. Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, Book 2) by Brandon Sanderson (4/5) on [04-01-2016]

   > This book has an excruciatingly slow first portion where nothing much happens. Just like the first book in this series, however, it gradually built up to a very exciting second-half.
   >
   > I hope Sanderson leaves out the fat from the other books in this series (he's still writing them).
   
7. Tender is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald (4.5/5) on [04-12-2016]

   > Dick Diver is a promising young psychiatrist who moves to Europe and begins a slow and terrible decline when he marries a wealthy American woman who is recovering from schizophrenia.
   >
   > Book one in this novel is centered around Rosemary, a young actress touring with her mother, who meets Dick at a resort and falls in love with him. I found it an absolute drag to read. No amount of beautiful prose was able to elevate what are essentially humdrum events.
   >
   > The rest of the novel, starting from book two which is a flashback to when Dick first encounters his future wife Nicole, seemed very, very different to me in substance as well as style. If I had stopped reading at book one I would have rated this as a 2/5. If I had skipped book one and read the rest I would have rated it as 5/5.
   >
   > Here is a line I enjoyed: *These dead, he knew them all, their weather-beaten faces with blue flashing eyes, the spare violent bodies, the souls made of new earth in the forest-heavy darkness of the seventeenth century.*
   >
   > *"Good-by my father - good-by all my fathers"*
