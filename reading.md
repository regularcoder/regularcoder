*I've spent my life at home, eating the food my wife cooks, listening to music, and being with Hikari. I feel I have chosen a good career - an interesting career. Every morning, I have woken up knowing that I will never run out of books to read. That has been my life.*

## Read in 2015

1. The wind in my wheels by Josie Dew (3.5/5)
> This is one of a few books that mysteriously appeared on my bookshelf - it could have been a donation from a relative cleaning out their shelves. This is a travel book about a British girl who traveled all over the world on her bicycle. It is a pretty straighforward narration of events and is book length only because Josie traveled so much. She doesn't spend much time on history (unlike Paul Theroux for example) or off-topic personal anecdotes (like the delightful Bill Bryson).
> 
> The most remarkable thing about this book is that she kept cycling despite being victimized by men throughout her travels - flashers, bum patters, would be rapists, etc. Josie doesn't say this herself but I noticed that one thing common to all cultures seems to be the presence of a few abusive men who won't hesitate to get their jollies from a young woman traveling alone.

2. Psmith in the City by P. G. Wodehouse (3/5)
2. The Allow of Law: A Mistborn Novel by Brandon Sanderson (4.5/5)
3. The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene (4/5)
4. Singularity Sky by Charles Stross (3/5)
5. Waiting by Ha Jin (2.5/5)
> Ha Jin's love story set in Communist China lost my favor towards the end where at multiple times he seemed to be building towards a tragic end - only to happily resolve the situation and build up towards yet another tragedy that never happens. When the story *finally* petered out it wasn't a very satisfactory ending.
>
> An interesting (to me) fact is that Ha Jin lives and teaches in Boston - where I read this book.
