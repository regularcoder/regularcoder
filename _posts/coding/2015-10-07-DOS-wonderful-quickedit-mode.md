Right-click and go to Properties:
![Subfolders]({{ site.url }}/img/quickedit/properties.png)

Check the QuickEdit Mode checkbox and click OK.
![Subfolders]({{ site.url }}/img/quickedit/checkbox.png)

You will now able to do various time-saving things like:

1. If you want to copy something just drag your mouse over it and either hit Enter or right-click.
2. To paste text from the clipboard just right-click.
	
These are things that I enjoyed for a long time in PuTTY and it's great that I now learned to do them in the DOS command prompt too - things move so much faster.
