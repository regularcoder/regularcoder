While preparing for the Salesforce.com Certifiied Force.com Developer exam I thought I would catalog all the resources I have been using to learn Salesforce *from scratch* with no prior experience.

These resources are freely provided by Salesforce.com and are available as PDF, HTML and hard copies too.

1. [Force.com Platform Fundamentals](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/fundamentals/salesforce_creating_on_demand_apps.pdf)

2. [Force.com Developer Certification: A Practical Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Force.com_Developer_Certification:_A_Practical_Guide)

3. [Force.com Workbook](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/workbook/forcecom_workbook.pdf)

4. [Salesforce Certified Force.com Developer - Study Guide](http://certification.salesforce.com/SG_CertifiedDeveloper.pdf)
