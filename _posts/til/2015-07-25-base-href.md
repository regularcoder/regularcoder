Browsers usually resolve (i.e. fully expand) relative paths by looking at the URL in address bar. For ex, if the address bar said http://google.com/folder/subfolder/, a link to just document.pdf would resolve to http://google.com/folder/subfolder/document.pdf. You can override this default behavior by using the &lt;base&gt; tag.
	
The base tag affects only relative URLs. Fully qualified URLs (ex: those which start with www, http:// or file://) are not affected.

Here is an example to make things clear:
{% highlight html linenos %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Document</title>
	<base href="http://www.google.com/folder/subfolder/">
</head>
<body>
	<a href="http://google.com/absolute/document.pdf">Absolute URL</a><br/>
	<a href="/document.pdf">Root URL</a><br/>
	<a href="document.pdf">Unqualified URL</a><br/>
	<a href="./document.pdf">Relative URL #1 (current folder)</a><br/>
	<a href="../document.pdf">Relative URL #2 (parent folder)</a><br/>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

* The absolute URL is unaffected and resolves to http://google.com/absolute/document.pdf
* The root URL picks the top-most part of the base URL and resolves to http://www.google.com/document.pdf
* Unqualified (my terminology) resolves to http://www.google.com/folder/subfolder/document.pdf
* Relative URL #1 resolves to http://www.google.com/folder/subfolder/document.pdf
* Relative URL #1 resolves to http://www.google.com/folder/document.pdf

## Real-life example
Yesterday I faced an issue where Internet Explorer wasn't resolving URLs the way I wanted them to. URLs in my HTML file all started with a forward slash:

{% highlight html %}
<A Href="/F:/autogen/trust/pdfs/47456.pdf">2014 - 2015 </A>
{% endhighlight %}

Internet Explorer translated the leading / to mean: file://F:/F:/autogen/trust/pdfs/47456.pdf (F: appears twice) instead of just file://F:/autogen/trust/pdfs/47456.pdf. 

The reason behind this is that a leading / indicates top-level part of the URL. Since the browser URL said file://F:/trustoutput.html, IE translated the / to mean file://F:/. Since it wasn't possible to change the auto-generated links I got around this by using the <base> tag to change the base URL to be just file://:
	
{% highlight html %}
<head>
<base href="file://">
</head>
<A Href="/F:/autogen/trust/pdfs/47456.pdf">2014 - 2015 </A>
{% endhighlight %}

The link now correctly resolved to file://F:/autogen/trust/pdfs/47456.pdf
