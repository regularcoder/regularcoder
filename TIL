Here are a few things I learned about ES2015/ES6:

## Freezing objects
In ES2015 it is possible to _freeze_ an object so that it is immutable. You will not be bale to modify property values or add new properties.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
const myConstObj = {
  age: 21,
  name: 'Rahul'
};

//Line below throws an error: "myConstObj" is read-only
//myConstObj = {age: 12, name: 'Varys'};

//You can, however, change property values since you are changing the contents of the variable
//and not the variable reference itself
myConstObj.age = 22;
//You can add new properties too
myConstObj.state = 'MH';

Object.freeze(myConstObj);

//Once the object is frozen you can no longer modify property values or add new properties
//Line below throws an error: Cannot assign to read only property 'age' of object
//myConstObj.age = 23;

//Line below throws an error: Cannot add poperty country, object is not extensible
//myConstObj.country = 'IN';
{% endhighlight %}
